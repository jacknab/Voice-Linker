# Phone Booth — Adult Voice-Line IVR Chat Service

## Overview

A Twilio-powered voice party line where callers can record profiles, browse other callers' voice profiles, exchange voice messages, and purchase memberships via phone keypad IVR or the web. The web layer supports account creation, phone number linking, and a full membership purchase flow (Stripe + PayPal).

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui (admin dashboard at `/backstage`, public membership page, web auth)
- **Backend**: Express (TypeScript) + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- **Voice**: Twilio TwiML IVR system
- **Payments**: Stripe (web checkout + IVR card entry) + PayPal Standard (web checkout via IPN)

## Replit Runtime

- Development workflow: `npm run dev`, serving the Express/Vite app on port 5000.
- Build command: `npm run build` — builds both the main client app AND the admin app (`malebox-admin/` → `dist/admin`).
- Production run command: `node ./dist/index.cjs`.
- Database schema is managed with Drizzle using `drizzle.config.ts`; sync with `npm run db:push`.
- Production startup requires `SESSION_SECRET`; development may use the local fallback only.
- Admin console: `/backstage` — pre-built into `dist/admin` on first dev startup. To force-rebuild after admin code changes, delete `dist/admin/` and restart the dev server.
- ElevenLabs keys are normalized server-side before API calls; the VPS PM2 config also strips surrounding quotes/hidden characters from `.env` values to avoid false 401 invalid-key responses.
- Real-time caller presence now uses the `callers` table as the database source of truth (`status`, `joined_at`, `last_ping`, `greeting_played`). Profile browsing queries this table for active callers ordered by join time, and block visibility is applied in the database query rather than against an already-cached queue.
- **Greeting queue (rolling buffer + Redis)**: `browse-profiles` holds a per-callSid `CallerBrowseState` (buffer ≤ 3 profiles, `seenUserIds` for cycle tracking, `blockedUserIds` Set as a session-level block cache). This state is now backed by Redis (`server/redis.ts`) when `REDIS_URL` is set, with automatic in-memory fallback when Redis is unavailable. Types are defined in `server/ivr-browse-state.ts` and shared between the IVR and Redis layers. TTL is 30 minutes. State is deleted from Redis (and the fallback Map) in the call-status webhook alongside other per-call cleanup. `ivr-no-mailbox.ts` retains its own simpler in-memory Map (different state model, not migrated).
- **Redis admin status card**: Admin dashboard (DashboardTab) shows a "Redis State Store" card with connection status, ping latency, active browse session count, and a manual refresh button. Data comes from `GET /api/admin/redis/status`. Shows amber "Not configured" when `REDIS_URL` is unset, red "Unreachable" if configured but unreachable, green "Connected" when working.
- **setup.sh Redis integration**: Step 2 installs `redis-server` and enables/starts the service. Step 6 generates a random password (or reuses existing from `.env`), configures `/etc/redis/redis.conf` (bind 127.0.0.1, requirepass, 128mb maxmemory, AOF persistence), restarts Redis, verifies with PING, and writes `REDIS_URL=redis://:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:6379` to `.env`. The final setup summary includes a Redis PING command for post-install verification.

## Roger Mood + Attention Drain Engine

**Roger** is the single AI host character that interjects between profile plays. He has 4 moods and a behavioral timing system:

### Attention Drain System (`server/engagementEngine.ts`)
- **Score 0–10**: rises with user inactivity; falls when the user engages
  - +2 per skip, +3 per 30s idle, +2 per 30s with 0 messages sent
  - -5 on message sent, -10 on game start
- **Interrupt Gate** (drain-adaptive cooldown):
  - drain < 3 → Roger stays silent
  - drain 3–5 → 90s cooldown, light prompts only
  - drain 6–7 → 60s cooldown
  - drain 8–10 → 45s cooldown, strong prompts + game invites

### Roger's 4 Moods
| Mood | Trigger | Energy |
|---|---|---|
| **normal** | Default state | Warm, patient, gently nudging |
| **petty** | `picky` flag (≥8 skips or 2+ min with 0 msgs) | Sassy, calling out the behavior |
| **activated** | `active` (≥2 msgs) or `engaged` (4+ min) | Hyped, celebratory |
| **chaos** | `gamePlayed` flag (after Busted game) | Game-show energy, unpredictable |

- Mood switches every 60–90s (randomized); major events (skip/message/game) force an immediate recalc
- **155+ prompts** in `PROMPT_LIBRARY` each tagged with `requiredMoods`, `minAttentionDrain`, `maxAttentionDrain`

### Admin: Audio Gen → Roger Tab
- `GET /api/admin/roger/prompts` returns the full prompt library with audio file status
- Per-prompt: Generate (→ `roger_<id>.mp3` in uploads/), Play, Delete
- Bulk "Generate Missing" button for batch audio generation
- Filter by mood tab (All / Base / Normal / Petty / Activated / Chaos) + text search

### IVR Audio File Fallback
- When `getInterruption()` fires, the prompt ID is passed as `?pid=` to `/voice/engagement-interrupt`
- If `uploads/roger_<id>.mp3` exists → `twiml.play()` (pre-recorded voice)
- Otherwise → `twiml.say()` with Alice voice (live TTS fallback)

```

## Environment Variables (.env)

The project uses a `.env` file for all credentials. `dotenv` is loaded at the very top of `server/index.ts` and `drizzle.config.ts` so it applies everywhere (including `npm run db:push`).

`.env` is git-ignored. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Long random string for session signing |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio Console → Account Info |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Twilio Console → Account Info |
| `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` | Twilio Console → Phone Numbers |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | ElevenLabs → Profile → API Key |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` | ElevenLabs voice ID (default: `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`) |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API Keys |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks signing secret |

## Stripe Integration (Web)

- **NOTE**: The Replit native Stripe integration was dismissed by the user. Stripe is connected via the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` env var in `.env`.
- Do NOT attempt to use the Replit Stripe connector — use `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in `.env` instead.
- Web checkout: `POST /api/stripe/create-web-checkout` — creates a Stripe Checkout Session and returns the hosted URL
- Session verification: `GET /api/stripe/verify-checkout/:sessionId` — verifies session and applies plan credits to the linked phone user
- Webhook endpoint: `POST /api/stripe/webhook` — listens for `checkout.session.completed` and `payment_intent.succeeded`
- Stripe webhook URL to register: `https://<yourdomain>/api/stripe/webhook`
- IVR membership products (Bronze/Silver/Gold) are seeded via `npx tsx scripts/seed-membership.ts`
- In-memory idempotency guard: `processedCheckoutSessions` Set prevents double-crediting

## PayPal Integration (Web)

PayPal Standard is supported as an alternative payment method for web membership purchases. It is enabled by setting a PayPal business email in the Admin → Memberships tab.

### How it works

1. User clicks "Pay with PayPal" on `/membership`
2. Frontend calls `POST /api/paypal/create-web-checkout` with `{ planKey }`
3. Backend builds a PayPal Standard button URL (hosted payment page) encoding plan details in the `custom` field as base64: `webUserId|planKey|linkedPhone|planMinutes|planName`
4. User is redirected to PayPal to complete payment
5. PayPal sends an IPN POST to `POST /api/paypal/ipn`
6. Server verifies the IPN with PayPal's IPN validation endpoint (`ipnpb.paypal.com` or `ipnpb.sandbox.paypal.com`)
7. On `payment_status=Completed`, the custom field is decoded and credits are applied to the linked phone user via `storage.updateUserMembership`
8. User lands on `/membership/success?method=paypal` which shows a "Payment Received" confirmation (PayPal activation is async via IPN, not instant like Stripe)

### PayPal admin configuration

In Admin → Memberships tab, there is a "PayPal Setup" card with:
- **PayPal Business Email** — the email on the PayPal Business account (leave blank to disable PayPal on the purchase page)
- **Sandbox Mode toggle** — when ON, directs payments to `www.sandbox.paypal.com` and verifies IPNs against `ipnpb.sandbox.paypal.com`
- **IPN URL display** — copyable URL (`/api/paypal/ipn`) to configure in PayPal account settings

### PayPal IPN setup (in PayPal account)

1. Log in to PayPal Business account
2. Go to Account Settings → Notifications → Instant payment notifications
3. Enter the IPN URL: `https://<yourdomain>/api/paypal/ipn`
4. Set IPN messages to "Enabled"

### PayPal idempotency

In-memory Set `processedIpnTxns` prevents duplicate IPN deliveries from double-crediting the same transaction. This resets on server restart; for production persistence, consider storing processed `txn_id` values in the database.

## Web Membership Purchase Flow

The web layer provides a full self-service membership purchase flow for web users:

1. **Register / Log in** — web users authenticate at `/register` and `/login`; session stored in `req.session.webUserId`
2. **Link phone number** — user links their phone at `/dashboard`; required before purchasing (credits go to the phone-based `users` record)
3. **Choose plan** — `/membership` shows 3 dynamic plan cards (plan1/plan2/plan3 from `membershipSettings`)
   - "Pay with Card" button → Stripe Checkout
   - "Pay with PayPal" button → PayPal Standard (only shown when PayPal email is configured)
   - Un-authenticated or un-linked users see contextual warning banners instead of active buy buttons
4. **Post-purchase** — `/membership/success`
   - `?method=stripe&session_id=xxx` → verifies Stripe session and shows "Membership Activated!" with plan details
   - `?method=paypal` → shows "Payment Received!" with a note that activation follows via IPN (within minutes)

## Live 1-on-1 Connect Feature

When browsing profiles, callers can press **3** to request a live direct connection.

**Pre-flight checks (all must pass):**
1. Initiator has ≥ 5 minutes remaining
2. Target profile is not admin-uploaded or a virtual caller
3. Target is still on the line (has an active, non-virtual call)
4. Target has ≥ 5 minutes remaining
5. Target is not already in a live connection with someone else
6. Target has not blocked the initiator

**Call flow:**
- Initiator: plays disclaimer → `live-connect-wait` loop → "Calling [name] now" → plays `live_connect_ringing.mp3` (15s) → timeout if no answer
- Invitee: when they press 2 (next profile), sees the invite instead → chime + "This caller [name] would like to connect live" → press 1 accept / 2 decline / 3 hear greeting
- On accept: Twilio REST API redirects initiator mid-ring to join Twilio conference room; both hear "Connecting you now…"; either can press # or hang up to exit
- On timeout/decline: initiator hears failure message and returns to phone booth

**In-memory state (ivr-default.ts):**
- `pendingLiveInvites` — targetUserId → invite (TTL 30s)
- `liveConnectionUserIds` — Set of userIds currently bridged
- `liveConnectionCallSidMap` — callSid → userId for hangup cleanup

**New routes:** `/voice/live-connect-wait`, `/voice/handle-live-invite`, `/voice/live-connect-join`, `/voice/live-connect-complete`

**Audio files to upload (optional, falls back to TTS):**
- `live_connect_disclaimer.mp3` — Brief respect reminder to initiator
- `live_connect_chime.mp3` — Alert chime played before invite announcement
- `live_invite_options.mp3` — "To accept press 1, to decline press 2, to hear greeting press 3"
- `live_connect_ringing.mp3` — ~15 second ringing/hold music
- `live_connect_connecting.mp3` — "Connecting you now... press pound to exit. Enjoy!"
- `live_connect_failed.mp3` — "Unable to connect. Returning to phone booth."
- `live_connect_ended.mp3` — "Your live connection has ended."
- `live_connect_unavailable.mp3` — Generic "not available" message
- `live_connect_busy.mp3` — "That caller is already connected with someone else."
- `live_connect_left_line.mp3` — "That caller has left the line."
- `live_connect_no_minutes.mp3` — "You need at least 5 minutes remaining..."
- `live_invite_expired.mp3` — "That invitation has expired."

## Linked Regions Feature

Regions can be linked together so callers overflow into a nearby region's caller pool once they've heard everyone in their own.

**How it works:**
- Each region has an optional `linkedRegionId` (another region's UUID)
- The caller's queue is built from their local region profiles only
- After they hear the last profile and the queue wraps back to the beginning (`hasWrapped = true`), instead of looping the system redirects to `/voice/nearby-callers-offer`
- The offer plays: "You've heard all the callers in your area. Press 1 to hear callers from [Linked Region Name]. Press 2 to start over."
- **Press 1**: The linked region's currently-active profiles are fetched and replace the queue; the caller continues browsing seamlessly
- **Press 2 / timeout**: Queue resets to index 0, local region restarts
- Once the offer has been made (`linkedRegionLoaded = true`), it is not triggered again for the rest of the call session

**Admin UI (Regions tab):**
- Edit/create region dialog has a "Linked Nearby Region" dropdown listing all other regions with their phone numbers
- Region cards show an amber "Linked: [Region Name]" badge when a link is configured

**IVR routes:** `/voice/nearby-callers-offer`, `/voice/handle-nearby-callers`

**Audio files (optional, TTS fallbacks included):**
- `nearby_callers_offer.mp3` — "You've heard all callers in your area. Press 1 for nearby, Press 2 to restart."
- `nearby_callers_intro.mp3` — "Now playing callers from [Region Name]. Enjoy!"
- `nearby_callers_none.mp3` — "No callers online in that area. Starting over."

## Membership PIN (Cross-Phone Access)

Members can set a 4-digit PIN that allows them to call in from **any phone** by entering their membership number + PIN.

**How it works:**
- Members on their registered phone can set/change their PIN via IVR: Main Menu → Press 8 (Manage Membership) → Press 2 (Set/Change PIN)
- The IVR asks for a new 4-digit PIN, then asks them to confirm by entering it again
- Once set, they can call from any phone, enter their membership number (5-digit card or 10-digit number), and then their 4-digit PIN to authenticate
- If no PIN is set, callers must use their registered phone number

**Admin controls:**
- Caller detail view shows whether a PIN is set (masked as ••••)
- Admin can set a specific PIN or clear it using the "Access PIN Management" panel in the caller detail view
- PIN API: `PATCH /api/admin/callers/:id/pin` with `{ pin: "1234" }` or `{ pin: null }` to clear

**In-memory state (ivr-default.ts):**
- `pendingPinAuth` — callSid → membership holder phone (awaiting PIN entry)
- `pendingNewPinSetup` — callSid → first PIN entry (awaiting confirmation)

**IVR routes:** `/voice/membership-pin-entry`, `/voice/handle-membership-pin-entry`, `/voice/set-pin`, `/voice/handle-set-pin`, `/voice/handle-confirm-pin`

## Membership Cards (IVR)

- 5-digit membership cards are entered at `/voice/membership-entry` in per-minute billing mode.
- The DTMF gather now waits 20 seconds and posts empty results to the handler, preventing callers from being advanced immediately after the prompt if they wait until playback finishes.
- Successful card PIN verification links the card to the caller's phone number via `membership_cards.phone_number` / `first_used_at`, rejects use from a different phone after activation, and automatically reuses the linked card on later calls from that phone.
- Card balances are deducted directly from `membership_cards.value_seconds` during per-minute billing through `callCardOverride`.

## Auto-Moderation System

**Service:** `server/autoModeration.ts` — runs asynchronously after every flag, block, and recording transcription event.

### Flag & Block Rules

- **Rule 1 — Flag Threshold:** 3+ distinct callers flag the same content → auto-escalate to admin queue (auto-flag)
- **Rule 2 — Block Count:** 3+ distinct callers block the same person within 24 hours → auto-flag their profile
- **Rule 4 — Repeat Flagging:** Content removed before and flagged again (2+ prior removals) → auto-remove + restrict
- **Rule 5 — New Account Flag:** Account flagged within 10 minutes of creation → auto-restrict
- **Auto-remove Threshold:** 5+ unique flaggers → auto-remove content; restricted user gets banned on 2nd auto-remove

**Account status enforcement in IVR:**
- `banned` → rejected at `/voice/entry-check` with hangup
- `restricted` → blocked from going live at `/voice/go-live`; can still browse

### Recording Auto-Moderation (Transcription Checks)

Every caller greeting and personal ad recording is automatically transcribed by Twilio. After each transcription arrives at `/voice/transcription-callback`, `runTranscriptionAutoChecks()` runs the following three checks in order:

**Check 1 — No Audio / Blank Transcription**
- Triggered when: transcription text is null, empty, or only whitespace
- Rejection reason: `"unclear"`

**Check 2 — Phone Number Detected**
- Triggered when: the transcription contains a 7- or 10-digit phone number in any format
- Detection covers:
  - Standard formatted numbers: `303-430-2099`, `(303) 430-2099`, `303.430.2099`
  - Compact digit sequences: `3034302099`
  - Filler-separated spoken numbers: `303 uh 430 2099` (only explicit filler words like "uh", "um", "and" can bridge digit groups — regular words reset the accumulator)
  - Spoken digit words: "three zero three four three zero two zero nine nine"
- False positive protection: real-world descriptors like "I'm 25, 6 foot 2, 210 pounds" do NOT trigger this — regular words between numbers reset the digit accumulator immediately
- Rejection reason: `"phone_number"`

**Check 3 — Low Quality / Repeated Words**
- Triggered when any of the following are true:
  - Fewer than 4 total words in the transcription
  - A non-common content word (not in the stop word list) repeats 3 or more times — e.g. "hey hey hey boys" → "hey" repeats 3×
  - More than 80% of content words are the same single word
- Stop word list: common English words that naturally repeat in speech (I, I'm, and, the, or, looking, like, etc.) are excluded from the repetition analysis so natural greetings aren't penalised
- "hey" and "hello" are intentionally NOT in the stop word list so greeting-word spam is still caught
- Rejection reason: `"unclear"`

**When a recording is rejected:**
1. The recording is deleted from the system (`deleteProfileByUserId` for greetings, `clearMailboxAdByUserId` for personal ads)
2. A rejection flag is set on the user's database record: `recordingRejectionReason` ("unclear" or "phone_number") and `recordingRejectionType` ("greeting" or "personal_ad")
3. A moderation event is written to `moderation_logs`
4. When the caller next calls in, the IVR intercepts them before they reach the main menu

**When the caller calls back (IVR interception):**
- **Greeting rejection** → intercepted at `/voice/entry-check` before going to the main menu
- **Personal ad rejection** → intercepted at `/voice/my-mailbox` before seeing the mailbox menu

**Rejection IVR Menus:**

*Reject 1 — Unclear recording* (`/voice/recording-rejected-unclear` + `/voice/handle-recording-rejected-unclear`):
> "You need to re-record your [greeting/personal ad] because we can't understand it. Please speak clearly into the phone so that everyone can hear what you have to say about yourself and what you're looking for. Be sure to turn down loud music or the television before you record. To re-record your [greeting/personal ad], press 1."
- Press 1 → routes to re-record flow (name + greeting for greetings; `/voice/record-mailbox-greeting` for personal ads); clears the rejection flag

*Reject 2 — Phone number in recording* (`/voice/recording-rejected-phone-number` + `/voice/handle-recording-rejected-phone-number`):
> "You need to re-record your [greeting/personal ad]. Please do not include your phone number in your [greeting/personal ad] or it will not be approved. To re-record your [greeting/personal ad], press 1."
- Press 1 → routes to re-record flow; clears the rejection flag

**Rejection flag lifecycle:**
- Set: by `runTranscriptionAutoChecks()` after a failed transcription check
- Cleared: automatically when the caller saves a new recording via `save-profile`, `save-mailbox-greeting`, or `save-category-ad` — the new recording then goes through auto-mod again
- Also cleared: when the caller presses 1 on either rejection menu before being routed to re-record

**New storage methods added:**
- `getUserByProfileRecordingUrl(url)` — look up user by their greeting recording URL
- `getUserByMailboxAdRecordingUrl(url)` — look up user by their mailbox ad recording URL
- `setUserRecordingRejection(userId, reason, type)` — set rejection flag
- `clearUserRecordingRejection(userId)` — clear rejection flag
- `clearMailboxAdByUserId(userId)` — clear a mailbox ad recording without deleting the mailbox record

**Admin panel additions:**
- **Callers tab:** Status badge column (Active/Restricted/Banned); Restrict/Ban/Restore buttons in caller detail view
- **Moderation Log tab:** Full event history with timestamp, phone, event type, rule triggered, content type, reason

**Admin API routes:**
- `PATCH /api/admin/users/:id/account-status` — set `active`, `restricted`, or `banned`
- `GET /api/admin/moderation-logs?targetUserId=&limit=` — fetch moderation event history

## Database Schema

- `users` — phone number, stripeCustomerId, membershipTier, remainingSeconds, membershipPin (4-digit), `accountStatus` (active/restricted/banned), membershipStartedAt, `recordingRejectionReason` (null/"unclear"/"phone_number"), `recordingRejectionType` (null/"greeting"/"personal_ad")
- `webUsers` — web account (email, passwordHash, linkedPhoneNumber, sessionId)
- `membershipSettings` — dynamic plan config (plan1/plan2/plan3 names, minutes, prices), billingMode, Stripe keys, `paypalEmail`, `paypalSandbox`
- `moderation_logs` — auto-moderation event log (event type, rule, reason, target user, content ref)
- `profiles` — voice recording URLs (Twilio or local uploads)
- `messages` — voice messages between users
- `active_calls` — real-time tracking of callers on the line
- `blocked_users` — blockerId + blockedUserId pairs for live connect access control; includes `created_at` for 24h window queries
- `regions` — regional phone markets; includes `linkedRegionId` (nullable UUID) for cross-region overflow
- `promoCodes` — promotional codes for discounts or free access
- `callLogs` — per-call log records for reporting and stats

## Admin Audio Gen Tab

The **Audio Gen** tab (`/admin` → Audio Gen) provides tools to generate ElevenLabs TTS audio files for the IVR system.

### Category Folder Selection
Choose **Shared**, **MM**, or **MW** before generating. Files are saved to:
- `uploads/` (shared)
- `uploads/mm/` (MM override)
- `uploads/mw/` (MW override)

The phone system automatically plays the correct folder's version based on the **Site Category** setting.

### TTS Preview (Play Button)
In the **Custom Audio File** section, a **play button** sits to the left of the "Text to Speak" input. Clicking it:
1. Sends the typed text to the `/api/admin/tts/preview` endpoint
2. ElevenLabs generates the audio using the configured `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`
3. The MP3 is streamed back and played in the browser — **nothing is saved to disk**
4. The button turns amber/spinning while playing; click again to stop

**API route:** `POST /api/admin/tts/preview` — body `{ text }` → streams `audio/mpeg` response

### Generate All
The **Generate All** button in the System Prompts section header generates every system prompt sequentially into the currently selected folder:
1. Iterates through `SYSTEM_PROMPTS` (defined in `Admin.tsx`) one at a time
2. For each prompt, calls `POST /api/admin/tts/generate` with the prompt text and selected folder
3. Uses any edited prompt text saved in `localStorage` (`admin_prompt_texts`) in place of defaults
4. Shows a live progress bar and current prompt name while running
5. The button switches to **Cancel** (red) during generation — clicking it stops after the current file finishes
6. On completion, shows a toast with the count of prompts generated and the target folder
7. Invalidates the file list cache so the status column updates immediately

### VPS Audio Health Check
The Audio Gen tab includes a health-check card backed by `GET /api/admin/tts/health`. It verifies:
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is configured and can reach ElevenLabs
- `uploads/`, `uploads/mm/`, `uploads/mw/`, and `uploads/mw_m/` exist and are writable
- Current MP3 file counts on the connected server
- Missing/generated counts for the selected prompt tab in the admin UI

Use this panel on the VPS-hosted admin page to confirm audio generation is ready before running bulk generation.

### Per-Folder Prompt Text Overrides
System prompt text edits are stored per audio folder using compound keys:
- `mm:<filename>.mp3`
- `mw:<filename>.mp3`
- `mw_m:<filename>.mp3`

This prevents editing a prompt in the MM tab from changing the text shown/generated in MW Female Voice or MW Male Voice. Older bare filename overrides are migrated into folder-specific keys only when a folder-specific value does not already exist.

### Custom Audio File
Manually generate a single named file outside the system prompts list. Enter a filename (`.mp3` is appended automatically) and the text to speak, then click **Generate**. Files are saved to the selected category folder.
